## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

* Is there documentation for the plugin?
  * Yes. Detailed documentation is available at http://kevinsspace.ca/testimonial-basics-user-documentation/

* Page load speeds are slow
  * If your page load speed is slow it will likely be because you are using Gravatars and you are not using a cache plugin. It is recommended that you use a cache plugin for any site, whether or not you are using Gravatars for Testimonial Basics. I use WP Super Cache.

* My testimonial is not showing?
  * Ensure it is approved.

* I just approved a testimonial and it is not showing?
  * If you have a cache plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, the page you use to display your testimonials may be cached. Simply edit the page and update it or wait and the cached files will eventually be deleted and refreshed.

* When I input a color number in the cell the color won't change?
  * Hit the enter key.

* Why can't users upload photos?
  * Users are not allowed to upload photos because it is a security issue. Use of gravatars is highly recommended. Administrators have the ability to add images in the Edit Testimonials admin panel.
  * If someone wants to show me a safe way to upload photos, I will certainly look at it.
